                                                Summary Writing
   
         Here i started my first summary writing for the related concepts in Bindings for the Rendring ,Parsing
   Layout and Painting etc...

         1.ParseHtml

                     The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of code points, which is passed 
                     through a tokenization stage followed by a tree construction stage.
                     The output is a Document object.
                      
                     Parsing Html is forgiving by naturea and it is not straight forward
                     
                     The parsing flow is mainly used for document writing..here tokeniser is open and closing tag and
                     script can alter the document..link & style is halt js execution.the Speculative parsing  is based on Extyernal images scripts and css
                     The reentrant means the parsing process interrupted in same image.and 
                     the performance insight the Parse Html is 
                     Visualised and render.
   
         2.Parse Css
                     
                      The parse css process is based on the multiple tree for render objects styles layers and line boxes
                      and the Non-the Render tree is Non-Visuval elements head ,script title etc...

                             Nodes hidden vis for display:none;
                      dom  node to Render object is visuval output holds style & computed metrics 

         3.Layout

                        It is mainly used for recursive process
                      the Layout it's childrens are  will batch layout and immediate layout 
                      this layouts are performance wise split into Good ,bad and Realworld
        
         4.Paint
                     It's mainly used for creating layers and incrementalprocess
                     Painting is mainly produce the bitmap from each layers.

         5.RenderTree
                     
                     The render tree is construction of Layout and Paint.
